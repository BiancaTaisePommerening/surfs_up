## Statistical Analysis Overview

An investor interested in opening a surf and ice cream shop business in Oahu wants to know 
information about Oahu' temperature trends. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in order to determine if the business would be sustainable year-round.


## Results

To gather the results, SQLAlchemy was used to query the SQLite database while Python's Matplotlib library was used to plot the temperatures.

### June Temperature Statistics

- The image below represents the summary statistics for the June temperature DataFrame (june_df).
    - Average temperature 75F
    - Minimum temperature 64F
    - Maximum temperature 85F

- The following histogram shows the temperature frequency over the years during the month of June. It was split into 15 different bins, and it's noticeable that the frequency of temperatures was higher between 71F and 79F, which supports the average temperature of 75F found on the previous query (on the image above).
